Organize, Prioritize, Improve, move forward.

For right now I am focusing on how to gather and orgaize the various pieces of information I have floating around me. Data collection, classification, organization and most importantly fast access and use of all that information.

The beginning stages will be split between working on personal systems and learning coding structures. Git is one of the first steps. How better to organize my code than using software designed just for that purpose.
